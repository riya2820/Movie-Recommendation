# Movie Recommendation System 

This project is a movie recommendation system developed using machine learning algorithms, Python's sci-kit learn, and pandas library. The system uses two types of algorithms, content-based filtering and collaborative-based filtering, to generate movie recommendations for the user based on their past movie preferences.

# Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git.
Navigate to the project directory: cd movie-recommendation-system.
Install the dependencies: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn.

# Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook.
Navigate to the movie_recommendation_system.ipynb file.
Run the cells in the notebook.
The notebook contains the implementation of two algorithms, content-based filtering and collaborative-based filtering. The content-based filtering algorithm recommends movies to the user based on the similarity of the movie genres and tags to the ones the user has already watched. The collaborative-based filtering algorithm recommends movies to the user based on the similarity of the user's movie preferences to other users' preferences.

To test the system, the user can provide their past movie ratings in the ratings.csv file, and the system will generate movie recommendations for them based on their preferences.


# Limitations

The movie recommendation system has certain limitations, including:

The system's accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of the data provided.
The system does not take into account the user's mood or context when recommending movies.
